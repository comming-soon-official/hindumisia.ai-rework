                            Anti-Hindu hate is the anti-Hindu sentiment that
                            advances, amplifies, and articulates hatred against
                            Hindus and Hinduism. This is a toxic global
                            phenomenon influenced by the legacies of the past.

                            <br />
                            Anti-Hindu hate refers to bias, discrimination, or
                            prejudice directed towards individuals or
                            communities based on their association with
                            Hinduism, one of the world's oldest and most diverse
                            religions. This form of hate can manifest in various
                            ways, including:
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            • Verbal attacks
                            <br />
                            • Physical violence
                            <br />
                            • Dissemination of harmful stereotypes
                            <br />
                            • Spreading misinformation
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            It targets the core aspects of Hindu identity,
                            practices, and beliefs, aiming to marginalize or
                            vilify those who adhere to this faith.

                            own conviction, the difference has negligible impact
                            on the dharmic ecosystem's ability to counter
                            anti-Hindu Hate. "Hindumisia" is here to stay, and
                            so are the terms "Hinduphobia" and "Hindudvesha".
                            hindumisia.ai welcomes the use of all these terms.
                            All these terms will have to co-exist.
